# Merge-Manga
I wanted to practice reading a manga and being able to see both the japanese and the english versions of the same page one ofther the other so I created this script.
To functions properly you need to put the different versions of the same chapter or volume inside the en and the jp folders and run the script.
The result will be placed in the output folder with the seguent structure:
- page 01 jp
- page 01 en
- page 02 jp
- page 02 en
...
